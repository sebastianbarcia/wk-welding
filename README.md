## TOOLS PROJECT
⚒️ To create the site, these tools were mainly used: 

❤️ REACT JS : React is an open source Javascript library designed to create user interfaces with the aim of facilitating the development of applications in a single page.

✨ UI MATERIAL : Components, icons, styles, and layout grids of "Material UI" taken from
https://mui.com/

🔙 BACKEND : Using Firebase to call items that are hosted on the backend and to send order and contact information.

🎨 SASS: Sass was used to be able to articulate the style of the project.

🖌️ Images and vectors were worked with illustrator and photoshop.
